# Goal:  Move the vehicles into the correct folder.

# For example, the stroller.txt file is inside the motorized folder.  It should be moved into the human_powered folder.  This can be accomplished using both methods below:

# Method 1:
# $ mv stroller.txt ../human_powered/
# In this method, the ".." is used to move up one into the cli_vehicles folder and then the "human_powered" moves it into the human_powered folder.


# Method 2:
# $ mv stroller.txt ~/environment/Day02/cli_vehicles/human_powered/
# In this method, the stroller.txt file is moved using an EXACT directory.
